# RBAC-SYSTEM
ole-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model used to regulate user access to systems and resources based on their assigned roles. Instead of assigning permissions to individual users, RBAC groups users into roles and assigns permissions to these roles, ensuring a structured and secure access management system.

Key Components of RBAC:
Roles – Defined positions such as Admin, Manager, User, each with specific permissions.

Permissions – Actions that a role is allowed to perform, such as Read, Write, Edit, Delete.

Users – Individuals assigned specific roles based on their responsibilities.

Role Hierarchy (Optional) – Some RBAC systems include role hierarchies where higher-level roles inherit permissions from lower roles.
